# The Nature of Code
Hi. This is what I have been upto during the coronavirus break from college!
I have done these examples with references from Processing documentation, in addition to going through the basic examples.
You will find some of my overhauled versions of the traditional examples from the book.
Cannot say of how much use is this going to be. Nevertheless, it's so much fun!
